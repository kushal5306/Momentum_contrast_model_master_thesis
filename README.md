This repository contains my masterâ€™s thesis, "Self-supervised Pre-training for Hierarchical Image Classification," done with Geberit GmbH. It highlights the benefits of self-supervised pre-training on unlabeled data compared to traditional methods. Some details are restricted due to collaboration.
